# TODO
This TODO was originally developed for helping me focus on school.
I upgraded it to act as a Desktop app and have loads of settings, try it
out for yourself.
# Settings
The only part that isn't very intuitive is the config files.
In settings if you scroll down to 'Config Files' there is a load and a upload.
The way to upload is you type in a username and BAM! your config is in the cloud.
You can then share your username with your friends and they can enter it into the Load Config
Click 'Swap It All!' and they have your config!
